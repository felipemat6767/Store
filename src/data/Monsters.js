Dodging is essential when fighting ekimmaras. Their claws cannot be parried, and even if Black Blood is an available witcher brew, it is best to avoid being wounded altogether, if you can help it.",

        "susceptibility": "Katakans are invulnerable to steel, regenerate quickly, hear acutely and move at incredible speed. To even the odds one can temporarily immobilize katakans using the Yrden sign, then seize that moment to attack with all one's might – for there might not be another chanc",
        "tactics": "Katakans are notably smarter and more powerful than ekimmaras. Their power only increases at night, and so a witcher should take additional precautions if they hunt one at those late hours. Alternatively, the witcher should wait for daylight, so the katakan's natural regeneration is impaired. Yrden sign is one of the most valuable tools when hunting a katakan, undoing its invisibility, allowing a witcher to feed them a silver sword.",
